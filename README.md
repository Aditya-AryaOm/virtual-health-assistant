Dear Recruiter, I have created this project on topic "How can you help to 65+ years old to live a healthier and better life" so. I have created a healthy daily life schedular.  I have also created a city location based search where a patient can search about the doctors in his/her city and schedule and appointment with the doctor.
In the future we can also extend this app with mobile application.
